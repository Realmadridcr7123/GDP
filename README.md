GDP Analytics

This repository is dedicated to the analysis of GDP data and its implications using Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn.

Overview

This repository comprises Python code for examining the correlation between GDP, GDP per capita, and life expectancy across various countries and years. The code facilitates data cleansing, visualization, and analysis utilizing libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Files

GDP_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for data analysis.
gdp.csv: Sample dataset containing GDP data.
Life-Expectancy-Data.csv: Sample dataset containing life expectancy data.
extracted_data.csv: Output file containing cleaned and merged data.
Instructions

Installation: Ensure Python and the required libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) are installed on your system.
Dataset: Place the datasets gdp.csv and Life-Expectancy-Data.csv in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
Execution: Open the Jupyter Notebook (analysis.ipynb) and execute the code cells sequentially.
Analysis: Refer to the analysis comments within the notebook to comprehend the insights derived from the data.
Results: Visualizations and analysis outcomes will be presented within the notebook.
Analysis Overview

Data Cleaning: Integration of GDP and life expectancy datasets, removal of redundant columns, standardization of column names, selection of pertinent features, and preservation of cleaned data in a new CSV file.
Data Visualization: Scatter plot depicting the correlation between life expectancy and GDP per capita across different years, bar chart showcasing countries with life expectancy one standard deviation above the mean, and scatter plots illustrating countries with low GDP and high life expectancy, and low GDP per capita and high life expectancy.
Insights: Examination of the correlation between GDP, GDP per capita, and life expectancy, elucidation of factors influencing life expectancy disparities within and across economies.
Discussion: Deliberation on variations in life expectancy within major economies, comparison of scenarios based on total GDP and GDP per capita as indicators of large economies.
Conclusion

This analysis furnishes valuable insights into the correlation between economic indicators and life expectancy, emphasizing the intricate interplay of socioeconomic factors in shaping public health outcomes. The code and results serve as a resource for further research and policymaking endeavors aimed at enhancing health equity and socioeconomic development globally.
